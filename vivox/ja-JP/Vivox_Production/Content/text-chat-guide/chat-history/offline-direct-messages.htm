        <h1 class="Title">Offline direct messages</h1>
        <p><b>Note:</b>&#160;This feature is in Open Beta and is currently only available in the Core SDK. </p>
        <p>When you send a message to an offline user you will receive a <span style="font-family: monospace;">evt_account_send_message_failed</span> event. This can be used to relay the fact that the user receiving said message is offline. The message  gets archived and when the user that received that message signs in, they can retrieve their <a href="retrieve-account-chat-history.htm">account chat history</a> to see the message that was sent to them while offline.</p>
