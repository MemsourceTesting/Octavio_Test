        <h1 class="Title">Server-side recording decoder</h1>
        <p>Use the server-side recording (SSR) decoder service to generate .wav files from the audio data that is captured by SSR and then uploaded to the cloud as .tar files.</p>
        <p>After the .wav files are decoded, they are compressed into .zip files and uploaded back to the cloud in a subfolder of where the .tar files were found. By default, decoded subscriptions result in a single .wav file for each participant in the recorded conversation, and all files are the same duration. Other options are detailed in the SSR API documentation.</p>
