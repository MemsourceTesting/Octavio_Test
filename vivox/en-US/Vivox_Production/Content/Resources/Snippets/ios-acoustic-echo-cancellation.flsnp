        <h1 class="Title">Acoustic echo cancellation</h1>
        <p>When an iOS device plays and records audio at the same time, there is the possibility that a capture device could pick up the audio that is playing. The Vivox SDK includes acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), which helps to prevent this type of audio capture from occurring.</p>
        <p>By default, the Vivox SDK leverages the platform AEC provided by Apple, which is enabled or disabled by using dynamic voice processing switching (DVPS).</p>
