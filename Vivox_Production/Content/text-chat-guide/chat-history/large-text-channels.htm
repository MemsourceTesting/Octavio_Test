        <h1 class="Title">Large text channel setting</h1>
        <p><b>Note:</b>&#160;This feature is in Open Beta. </p>
        <p>The large text channels setting is an optional feature that allows a Vivox backend to support over 200 participants in a text channel.</p>
        <p>By default, the large text channel setting is disabled for all games, limiting those game channels to 200 users. With this feature enabled, text channels can support up to 2000 users.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Changes to large text channel configurations won’t take effect for an existing channel until every occupant of that channel has left and the channel is destroyed.</p>
        <h2>Enable large text channels</h2>
        <p>Large text channels are an enterprise-only feature. To enable this feature, contact your Vivox representative.</p>
